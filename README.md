# Engineering-Wellness-Centre-Shift-Log-Generator
This project is a mostly Python based program which takes statistics from the Engineering Wellness Centre of Queen's University and allows the admin to produce useful graphs to analyze data. 

The program works by retreiveing the statistical data from a Google sheet auto generated from Google Forms data collection system. A python based GUI using the tkinter library is then used to allow the user to selected specific graphs and figures he/she wants generated. The GUI links to the back end of the system which utilises custom data processing algorthems to properly pass data into the graphing functions.
